	Mushroom Kingdom, Date unknown[BR]
	[BR]
	The evil King Koopa has stolen the[BR]
	Star Rod from Star Haven.[BR]
	He imprisoned its guardians, the[BR]
	Star Spirits, and placed them under[BR]
	the protection of various underlings.[BR]
	[BR]
	He used the power of the Star Rod to[BR]
	make himself invincible and seize the[BR]
	castle of Princess Peach, lifting it[BR]
	far up into the sky.[BR]
	[BR]
	The Star Spirits have requested the[BR]
	help of Mario to retrieve the Star Rod[BR]
	and save the princess.[BR]
	[BR]
	On his travels, Mario faced many[BR]
	challenges. One by one, he overcame[BR]
	his struggles and rescued the Star[BR]
	Spirits.[BR]
	[BR]
	Now, he must use their power to[BR]
	travel to the floating castle and put[BR]
	an end to the invincible king's reign.[BR]
	[BR]
	However, there are many challenges[BR]
	hidden within the vast reaches of[BR]
	the cosmos.[BR]
	[BR]
	Will Mario be able to fight his way[BR]
	through? Or will the entire Mushroom[BR]
	Kingdom succumb to Bowser's power?[BR]
